# Deep-Learning-Projects
## Overview
This project demonstrates clustering techniques on real-world datasets using Python and scikit-learn. The project includes implementations of k-means clustering and density-based clustering (DBSCAN) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Key Components
1. **K-Means Clustering on Breast Cancer Dataset**
   - Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA.
   - Visualized clusters using 2D scatter plots.
   - Analyzed data distribution and clustering results.

2. **DBSCAN Clustering on Digits Dataset**
   - Applied density-based clustering for high-dimensional data.
   - Visualized clusters for labels 0 through 22.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Acknowledgments
This project is part of the Data Science coursework for CAP 6619.
